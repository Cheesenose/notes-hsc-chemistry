Assessing Primary and Secondary Sources
=======================================

    Students identify trends, patterns and relationships; recognise error, uncertainty and limitations in data; and interpret scientific and media texts. They evaluate the relevance, accuracy, validity and reliability of the primary or secondary-sourced data in relation to investigations.

    The definitions of accuracy, reliability, and validity are taken from `Resources for science instruction (NSW Education) <https://education.nsw.gov.au/teaching-and-learning/curriculum/key-learning-areas/science/stage-6/resources>`_

Primary Sources
---------------

.. _accuracy:

Accuracy
^^^^^^^^

The extent to which a measured value agrees with the true value.
Requires prior knowledge about the value to be measured.

An experiment which is accurate should show a value that is close to the true value.

.. _reliability:

Reliability
^^^^^^^^^^^

The extent to which the findings of repeated experiments, conducted under identical or similar conditions, agree with each other.
Repeating the experiment minimises the effect of outliers, etc.

.. _validity:

Validity
^^^^^^^^

The extent to which an experiment addresses the question under investigation.
Requires the experiment to be reliable, accurate, and precise.
In addition, you must be only changing ONE *independent variable*, and *controlling* all the other variables.
It must also be using the correct equipment, and addressing the aim.
Validity can be assesed with:

* mention variables being controlled
* only ONE variable should be changed, and its effect on ONE dependent variable
* state how errors (e.g. friction in a pendulum swing gravity experiment) have been minimised (or not)

Precision
^^^^^^^^^
.. note::
    This is not part of the chemistry syllabus.
    However, it is important to know this as it is a **distinct** category to accuracy or reliability.

The extent to which multiple measurements, made under identical or similar conditions, agree with each other (i.e. variations within a dataset).

This is referring to the *uncertainty* of measurements, i.e. how close the measured the value is to the value being measured.
Can be quantified with the range of values, written as: :math:`5\pm1`.

.. note::
    See *Mainpulating Uncertainties* in `Resources for science instruction (NSW Education) <https://education.nsw.gov.au/teaching-and-learning/curriculum/key-learning-areas/science/stage-6/resources>`_ for how to combine uncertainties.

Secondary Sources
-----------------

Reliability
^^^^^^^^^^^

The consistency of information between sources.
Can be evaluated through showing that various sources all gave the same information.

Validity
^^^^^^^^

The appropriateness of the information. Needs to consider:

* the author's credentials (are they qualified in that field)

* the purpose of the article - is it biased?

* is it current (not outdated - this is not "recent")

* is the publisher reputable?


Accuracy
^^^^^^^^

The information needs to be both valid and reliable.
