Applying Chemical Ideas
=======================

    The identification and analysis of chemicals is of immense importance in scientific research, medicine, environmental management, quality control, mining and many other fields.
    Students investigate a range of methods used to identify and measure quantities of chemicals.
    They investigate and process data involving the identification and quantification of ions present in aqueous solutions.
    This is particularly important because of the impact of adverse water quality on the environment.
    Students deduce or confirm the structure and identity of organic compounds by interpreting data from qualitative tests of chemical reactivity and determining structural information using proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
