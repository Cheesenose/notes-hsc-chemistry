Equilibrium and Acid Reactions
==============================

    Chemical systems may be open or closed.
    They include physical changes and chemical reactions that can result in observable changes to a system.
    Students study the effects of changes in temperature, concentration of chemicals and pressure on equilibrium systems, and consider that these can be predicted by applying Le Chatelierâ€™s principle.
    Students also analyse the quantitative relationship between products and reactants in equilibrium reactions to determine an equilibrium constant.
    From this calculation, they predict the equilibrium position, either favouring the formation of products or reactants in a chemical reaction.
    This module also allows students to understand that scientific knowledge enables scientists to offer valid explanations and make reliable predictions.
    Students make reliable predictions by comparing equilibrium calculations and equilibrium constants to determine whether a combination of two solutions will result in the formation of a precipitate.
