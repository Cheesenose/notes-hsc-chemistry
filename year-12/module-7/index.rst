Organic Chemistry
=================

    Students focus on the principles and applications of chemical synthesis in the field of organic chemistry.
    Current and future applications of chemistry include techniques to synthesise new substances – including pharmaceuticals, fuels and polymers – to meet the needs of society.
    Each class of organic compounds displays characteristic chemical properties and undergoes specific reactions based on the functional groups present.
    These reactions, including acid/base and oxidation reactions, are used to identify the class of an organic compound.
    In this module, students investigate the many classes of organic compounds and their characteristic chemical reactions.
    By considering the primary, secondary and tertiary structures of organic materials, students are provided with opportunities to gain an understanding
    of the properties of materials – including strength, density and biodegradability – and relate these to proteins, carbohydrates and synthetic polymers
