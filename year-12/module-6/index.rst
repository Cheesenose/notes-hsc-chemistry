Acid/Base Reactions
===================

    Students analyse how and why the definitions of both an acid and a base have changed over time, and how the current definitions characterise the many chemical reactions of acids. Acids react in particular ways to a variety of substances.
    These reactions follow a pattern that students identify and explore in detail.
    Acids and bases, and their reactions, are used extensively in everyday life and in the human body.
    The chemistry of acids and bases contributes to industrial contexts and the environment. Therefore, it is essential that the degree of acidity in these situations is continually monitored.
    By investigating the qualitative and quantitative properties of acids and bases, students learn to appreciate the importance of factors such as pH and indicators.
