This is a repository for new syllabus chemistry notes, for the NSW HSC curriculum.
This will mainly serve as my notes, however the goal is to provide an open platform for chemistry knowledge, free of charge.

Goals
-----
- To provide notes that are:
    - understandable to senior students
    - free
    - sorted by syllabus contents
- To allow anyone to add to or improve on the explanations within

What this isn't
---------------
- This is not supposed to be a replacement for a reputable textbook (Pearson or Chemistry in Focus)
- There are no guarantees as to the accuracy of the knowledge within this document

Contributing
------------
- Please see the [RST and Sphinx Cheatsheet](https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html) and the [Git cheatsheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
- **Please ensure that you have rights to all images you contribute.** This means **no** screenshots of either the Pearson or CIF textbooks. If necessary, this might mean referring to a specific figure in a textbook, or creating your own (straight copies are *still copies*).
- If you have images under a Creative Commons license, please add attribution
- Please have git commits in the following format: `[<area>] <add/remove/update> <dotpoint>`, where:
    - `<area>` is either: `structure`, `project`, or `module-X`
    - `<dotpoint>` is the dotpoint being updated
    - For example, `[module-8] Add qualitative tests for the presence of aqueous ions`
